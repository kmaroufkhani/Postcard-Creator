# Postcard-Creator
This web page displays a postcard template where the user can upload a picture and write a text. The user can choose a background color and font. Upon clicking the "Share" button, the website displays a url where the user or any other person on their web browser can paste that link, which takes them to a page that displays the postcard. The viewer cannot change anything about the postcard, they can only view it.
NOTE: The images are not uplaoded to any folder, but rather to an online inventory dedicated to each UC Davis student enrolled in ECS 162.
